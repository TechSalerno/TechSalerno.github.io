      <description>My name is Christian, I was born in Cava dei Tirreni, a small town of about 80k inhabitants less than 10km from Salerno.
I spent all my childhood, adolescence and my student period in this territory, developing that sense of belonging that unites entire peoples and that is able to make you appreciate the wonders that you have under your eyes every day (and that maybe, for a long time go, with the strength of the habit, then you tend not to notice anymore, taking them for granted).</description>

      <description>What Salerno is to me
I was born in California, north of San Francisco in the Napa Valley, during the earlier years of the wine industry boom. My father was a viticulturist then, helping establish vineyards that would last decades. My mother, an artist and immigrant from Brazil, came to the USA to escape political persecution and seek better opportunities. I spent part of my life as a child in Washington state, as well as going back and forth to Brazil to visit family.</description>
